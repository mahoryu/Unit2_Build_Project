# Mushroom Identification Project

This is a project I did for school to practice using predictive modeling techniques.
Included in the repo is the raw data and the details behind the dataset. 
The project notbook is my full code for the project showing how I came to my conclusions including 
visualization on why the different models predicted what they did.
